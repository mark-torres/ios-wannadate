# iOS9 Course: Wanna Date (Tinder clone)

This is the Tinder clone created following the course.

It uses shared framework files, so the actual framework paths must be set in the project settings in the *Search Paths* section.

The frameworks used are listed in the bridge header file, basically, Parse and Facebook.
